# *Atlanta Crime Analysis Report*

# *Introduction*
This repository contains the *Atlanta Crime Analysis Report*, developed to analyze crime activities in Atlanta, Georgia. Using Power BI, we explored crime trends, neighborhood-specific data, and the impact of lockdowns on crime rates. The analysis provides actionable insights to inform law enforcement, policymakers, and community initiatives.

# *Key Features*
- *Data Preparation*: Cleaning and transforming datasets using Power Query.
- *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)*: Identifying trends, crime hotspots, and seasonal patterns.
- *Time Series Forecasting*: Projecting future crime rates with 18-month forecasts.
- *Neighborhood Analysis*: Highlighting areas with the highest and lowest crime rates.
- *Lockdown Impact*: Comparing crime trends before, during, and after lockdown periods.

# *Project Objective*
To analyze crime activity in Atlanta using datasets that include crime data, transportation modes, neighborhood demographics, and socio-economic factors. This project focuses on:
1. Data cleaning and preparation.
2. Crime trend and seasonality analysis.
3. Forecasting future crime activity.
4. Evaluating the impact of lockdowns on crime rates.
